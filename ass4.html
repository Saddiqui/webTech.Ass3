<h1>Assignment 4: "Synthesis & Evaluation"</h1>
<h2>By Alina Saddiqui & Emily Zwueste | group 47 | 24.01.2021</h2>

        <b>Intro:</b>
        Our webpage is accessible to most users. The webpage is userfriendly when it comes to easy to detect and click on
        elements. The webpage had a white background with black text font to make it easy to read for users. This includes users
        thats are visually impaired. However after conducting the a evaluation on the web content Accessibility guidelines, we came 
        to the conclusion that our webpage is not a 100% accessible for the visually impaired, as the webpage does not support any program 
        with speech or a feature to use keyboard functions. 
        
        in spite of not being accessible to users with a disability, the webpage is accessible for users that do not have any complications. 
        The webpage consists of simple html code to compile the homepage of a webshop from assingment 1 and 2. 
        The form fields are easy to use, as they do not require any other action than clicking on them filling in and submitting them. 
        In addition to the easy to use field, there is a small pop-up under the field, in case the field is empty(when actually required).

        After the self evuluation, we do however recognise that builing websites comes with more than just some text and images op de page. 
        There are many Accessibility factors that should be considered when builing a webpage.

        <b>Accessibility highlights:</b>
        We think that the most relevant guidelines to our webpage are 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through 
        presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text.) & 1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence: When the sequence in which content is presented 
        affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.). This because we put most of our focus on getting the webpage in a 
        logic sequence when it comes to the header, navigationbar, text, table and footer. This is the basic sequence we followed to build a webpage, kind of 
        like writing an essay. We used the intro(header and navigationbar), middle content(text and table) and the end (the footer, in this case). 

        In addition to this we were also put a lot of thought to the layout of the webpage, regarding the layout of the elements on the webpage. 
        We wanted the elements on the webpage to be easily accesible. Thus, we used color and hover styling to make these easy to use. 
        The links to the different webpages are provided in the navigationbar with all the same text color, so they are easy to distinguish. 
        Each row in the table has a hover over them, so you can easily see all the information on one product when just looking at one of its elements.

    <b>Improvement plan:</b> The improvement plan we would follow to improve our webpage in terms of Accessibility and usability (Appendix A) 
    and feedback from the TA (Appendix B) has the following steps.
    <ul><em>1. Improve all technical aspects from the feedback of the TA, which includes the following:</em>
        <li>Structure the code neatly, by using the correct identation. To improve readability.</li>
        <li>eliminating the use of BR tags for new line.</li> 
        <li>Using the sections and abbr tag properly for the right purpose.</li>
        <li>Replace class with id, for single use identifiers</li>
        <li>Improve the responsiveness of the webpage, so it fits any desired screen with the right proportions.</li>
        <li>improve the code in such a way that the HMTL and CSS validator do not give an error.</li>
        <li>fist format data into json, before the use of serialize. And calling Preventdefault after the post action.</li>
        <li>Rename and clean up the JS file(matching comments to actual function).</li>
    </ul>
    <ul><em>2. Improve usability and Accessibility from the feedback of the TA, which includes the following:</em>
        <li>In the first assignment there was no interactive form on the webpage to add new products.
This was because we misunderstood the assignemnt, however we did already implement this improvement by adding an interactive form to add products.</li>
        <li>Add and define a print-style in the css file. And add a suffience difference in the screen style and print style.</li>
        <li>Take the webpage through a browser compatibility report and add the missing features.</li>
        <li>Improve the sort function to work on other inputs(numeric) in the table, instead of only working on alphabetic inputs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul><em>3. implement different improvements which correspond to the guidelines of appendix A, in terms of accessibility and usability.
        Which include the following:</em>
        <li>An alternative equivalent to non-text content would be added to easily acces and use content/features on the webpage.(
        Example: speech feature upon hovering over the element)</li>
        <li>Add astrisks(*) characters were fields in the form are required. And add a text line which shows the user which fields are required.</li>
        <li>Add links (which are distinguished by color)ordered list, the unvisited links list and the visited links list.</li>
        <li>Add a feature/program that will allow the user the use of a keyboard without specific requirements.</li>  
        <lil>When adding new pages to the webshop, we would add a mechanism to bypass blocks of content.</lil>
        <li>When adding new pages to the webshop, naming these pages with the corresponding content of the webpage shown.</li>
        <li>Adding easy to distinguish colors for the background and text, so users that are and aren't visually impaired can both use/read the content and
        use the features on the webpage easily. </li>
        <li>When adding audio/video on the webpage, there will be a audio/video control feature added. To control both playtime(play/pause/stop/repeat) and volume.</li>
    </ul>

            <td>1.1.1 Non-text Content: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the
            equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level A)</td>
            <td>The non-text content in our webpage doesnt have any alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
            The links that are on the homepage, cannot be easily accessed in forms that could be needed by others.
            For example any blind person may not be able to easily detect the location of a link, but with the help of a form
            that supports spoken words (speech) this can be easily Accessible.
            Also the navigation bar and the tables do not have a text-alternative that serve the equivalent purpose.
            This can be compared to the example above. In the case of the navigation bar and the table, no other form is supported
            on our webpage for easy Accessibility.
            
            We can conclude that our homepage does not have any text alternatives that serve the equivalent purpose as non-text
            content.
            Expect for the image and formatting content, whose only purpose is for decoration.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>1.3.1 Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be
            programmatically determined or are available in text. (Level A)</td>
            <td>Information, structure and relationships on the homepage are conveyed programmatically on the homepage.
            Information that is provided on the homepage like text, table and images are all styled in css by giving the
            corresponding texts
            the same color, font or even emphasise.
            For example: the texts in the navigationbar are all the same color as well as words that need to stand out.
            Also information that needs to stand out is emphasized by using bold or colored text.
            For example: the text in the navigationbar is all the same color for every navigationlink. This lets the user know
            that the links in the navigationbar have the same relation.(to navigate to the corrresponding page)
            
            Different heading are used in the homepage, but could have been used in a more proper manner if there was more text
            information
            on the homepage.
            The structure between the different products is also done programmaticly by the use of a table.
            Like the first row in the tables, they are written in bold letters. So the user can easily see the structure of the
            table, with the first row serving the purpose of naming the different columns. And the rows going vertically for each
            column name
            with the corresponding information on the product. Also giving the table a caption contributes to giving the user extra
            information
            for a userfriendly experience, as the user can easily find the subject of the table.
            
            lastly the input fiels that are required, dont show they are required until you try to subit the input.
            This however can be done easily by the use of a astrisk(*) character at the end of the fieldname in the form.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence: When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading
            sequence can be programmatically determined. (Level A)</td>
            <td>The homepage has a meaningful sequence to some extend. The title(header) of the homepage is provided on top of the page.
            Following this there is a navigationbar, that if positioned in another sequence would not be userfriendly.
            After the navigationbar there is some text and then come two tables.
            and the website has a footer at the end.
            For the sake of having a basic html webpage, the sequence is correct and does not deprive the webpage of it's meaning.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics: Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on
            sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. (Level A)</td>
            <td>We dont think this guideline applies to our webpage. As we do not have any instructions or operating content that is not
            accessible by text only. For example: someone who is colorblind or does have a weaker eyesight can still use the webpage
            as intended
            Without having difficulty understanding the operating content of instructions.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>1.4.1 Use of Color: Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting
            a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)</td>
            <td>The only color distinguished element on the page that can be hard to convey to users that do not perceive visuals as
            intentended,
            are the links under the navigation bar. These are colored different for each of the uses like unvisited links or visited
            links.
            These could for example be positioned in a ordered list, the unvisited links list and the visited links list.
            
            Also the hover collor (light grey) on the navigationbar, may not be recognised by some visual impaired users. However
            this
            shouldnt make a big difference in the Accessibility of the homepage.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>1.4.2 Audio Control: If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is
            available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall
            system volume level. (Level A)</td>
            <td>this does not apply to our webpage, as there is no audio being played on the webpage.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>2.1.1 Keyboard: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific
            timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the
            user's movement and not just the endpoints. (Level A)</td>
            <td>The webpage is accessible with any keyboard. There is no requirement for specific timings for individual keystrokes.
            The user can access any keyboard that is connected to the webpage and browse the webpage, as well as use the functions
            on the webpage. Only moving the cursor, typing, clicking, sizing and selecting are accessible on the webpage.
            
            However hand writing, painting, etc is not accessible on the webpage. There is no specific feature or program on
            the webpage that allows this. Thus, not succesfully complying to this guideline.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap: If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus
            can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or
            tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)</td>
            <td>This does not apply to our webpage, as we do not have any interface in which the keyboard could be trapped.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>2.4.1 Bypass Blocks: A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple Web pages.
            (Level A)</td>
            <td>There is no mechanism available to bypass blocks of content. This is due to no other webpages being made, expect for the
            homepage. So this guideline does not apply to our assignment.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>2.4.2 Page Titled: Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose. (Level A)</td>
            <td>In this case the title of the webpage is already named to the appropriate name "assigntment 1: homepage of a webshop".
            This indicating what the subject/intend for this webpage is. However there aren't sufficient webpages to show this
            impemented
            correctly, as we only made one webpage.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>2.4.3 Focus Order: If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation,
            focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability. (Level A)</td>
            <td>The webpage can be navigated sequentially. However the webpage is made up from required elements from assignment 1 and
            2, that do
            not require us to give the webpage a specific meaning when navigated sequentially.
            The webpage does have a basic sequence and follows the left hand navigation with the corresponding css stylesheet.
            
            The webpage can be operated easily with a logical tab order. For example: the navigation bar and the form.</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context): The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the link
            text together with its programmatically determined link context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous
            to users in general. (Level A)</td>
